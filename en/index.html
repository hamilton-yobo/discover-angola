      <div class="life-cost">
        <h3>Cost of Living</h3>
        <p>The cost of living in Angola can vary significantly depending on the region and lifestyle. Generally, Luanda, the capital, is known for having a relatively high cost of living compared to other cities in the country, primarily due to the high cost of imported goods and the high demand for housing and services.</p>
        <p>Here are some points to consider when evaluating the cost of living in Angola:</p>
        <ol class="life-cost-ol">
          <li class="life-cost-ol-li">
            <strong>Accommodation</strong>: Renting an apartment in Luanda can be quite expensive. Prices vary depending on the location, size, and quality of the property. In other cities in Angola, such as Benguela or Huambo, prices may be lower.
          </li>
          <li class="life-cost-ol-li">
            <strong>Food</strong>: Local food, especially when bought at markets and fairs, tends to be more affordable. However, imported foods can be expensive.
          </li>
          <li class="life-cost-ol-li">
            <strong>Transportation</strong>: Transportation costs can vary. In Luanda, public transportation is limited, and many residents rely on taxis or private cars. Fuel prices can also affect costs.
          </li>
          <li class="life-cost-ol-li">
            <strong>Health and Education</strong>: Health and education services in Angola can vary in quality and cost. Access to high-quality healthcare and international education tends to be more expensive, especially in urban areas.
          </li>
          <li class="life-cost-ol-li">
            <strong>Services and Entertainment</strong>: The costs of services and entertainment, such as dining out, cultural and sports activities, can be relatively high compared to other countries in the region.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you are considering moving to Angola or making a visit, it is a good idea to research specific areas and consult local sources to get a more accurate picture of current costs.</p>

        <h3>Taxi Services</h3>
        <p>Taxi services in Angola, especially in Luanda, vary in terms of availability and quality. Here are some important details about how taxi services work in Angola:</p>
        <ol class="taxi-service-ol">
          <li class="taxi-service-ol-li">
            <strong>Conventional Taxis</strong>
            <ul class="article-ul">
              <li class="article-ul-li">
                <strong>Identification</strong>: In Angola, conventional taxis do not have a standard color or marking, which can make them difficult to identify. Often, taxis are regular cars that can be hailed or found at taxi stands.
              </li>
              <li class="article-ul-li">
                <strong>Price Negotiation</strong>: In many cases, it is necessary to negotiate the fare before starting the trip, especially if the taxi does not use a meter. In larger cities like Luanda, some taxis may have meters, but this is not guaranteed.
              </li>
              <li class="article-ul-li">
                <strong>Taxi Stands</strong>: Taxis can be found at specific taxi stands, on the streets, or you can request a taxi by phone if you know the number of a local taxi service.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
