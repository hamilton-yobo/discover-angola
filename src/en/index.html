          Cost of Living
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
          The cost of living in Angola can vary significantly depending on the
          region and lifestyle. Generally, Luanda, the capital, is known for
          having a relatively high cost of living compared to other cities in
          the country, primarily due to the high cost of imported goods and the
          high demand for housing and services.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
          Here are some points to consider when evaluating the cost of living in
          Angola:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4 ml-2 md:ml-4">
            <strong>Accommodation</strong>: Renting an apartment in Luanda can
            be quite expensive. Prices vary depending on the location, size, and
            quality of the property. In other cities in Angola, such as Benguela
            or Huambo, prices may be lower.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4 ml-2 md:ml-4">
            <strong>Food</strong>: Local food, especially when bought at markets
            and fairs, tends to be more affordable. However, imported foods can
            be expensive.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4 ml-2 md:ml-4">
            <strong>Transportation</strong>: Transportation costs can vary. In
            Luanda, public transportation is limited, and many residents rely on
            taxis or private cars. Fuel prices can also affect costs.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4 ml-2 md:ml-4">
            <strong>Health and Education</strong>: Health and education services
            in Angola can vary in quality and cost. Access to high-quality
            healthcare and international education tends to be more expensive,
            especially in urban areas.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4 ml-2 md:ml-4">
            <strong>Services and Entertainment</strong>: The costs of services
            and entertainment, such as dining out, cultural and sports
            activities, can be relatively high compared to other countries in
            the region.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
          If you are considering moving to Angola or making a visit, it is a
          good idea to research specific areas and consult local sources to get
          a more accurate picture of current costs.

          Taxi Services
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
          Taxi services in Angola, especially in Luanda, vary in terms of
          availability and quality. Here are some important details about how
          taxi services work in Angola:
        </p>
        <ol class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
            <strong>Conventional Taxis</strong>
            <ul class="mb-2 md:mb-4 mt-2 md:mt-4">
              <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
                <strong>Identification</strong>: In Angola, conventional taxis
                do not have a standard color or marking, which can make them
                difficult to identify. Often, taxis are regular cars that can be
                hailed or found at taxi stands.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
                <strong>Price Negotiation</strong>: In many cases, it is
                necessary to negotiate the fare before starting the trip,
                especially if the taxi does not use a meter. In larger cities
                like Luanda, some taxis may have meters, but this is not
                guaranteed.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
                <strong>Taxi Stands</strong>: Taxis can be found at specific
                taxi stands, on the streets, or you can request a taxi by phone
                if you know the number of a local taxi service.

          The security of citizens in Angola is a broad topic involving various
          aspects. Here are some key points about the security system in Angola:

              <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
                <strong>National Police</strong>: The National Police of Angola
                is responsible for public security and maintaining order. It
                consists of several specialized units, such as traffic police
                and criminal police. The number of personnel may be limited in
                some areas, and there are challenges related to training and
                equipment.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
                <strong>Armed Forces</strong>: Although their primary role is
                national defense, the Armed Forces of Angola can also be
                mobilized to assist in emergencies and support the police in
                cases of civil disturbances.

                <strong>Urban Crime</strong>: In large cities like Luanda, there
                are concerns about urban crimes such as theft and robbery. Crime
                rates can vary depending on the area and time.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2 md:mb-4">
                <strong>Organized Crime</strong>: There are concerns about

                justice.

                resources can affect the legal security of citizens.

                vulnerability to crime.
